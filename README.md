# car_dent-detection

In this repo i used tensorflow  object detection api to detect the damage and dents in the car

I gathered all the data from google images and annotated them with the help og labelImg which stores the data in XML files and with help of xml to csv.py file i converted them to csv format and with the help of generate_tfrecord i created tfrecord files.

after that in my script i installed all the required packages from git.

rest of the code in explained in the notebook.
